# Lending Club Case Study
> Lending club , a finance company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. 
To be profitable in business, Lending Club needs to control credit loss which arises from lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants. 
To mitigate risky lending , the company must be able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss.
In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

## General Information
- What is the background of your project?

    The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the    amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?

    Lending Club wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. So   that company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. As per process, when the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. In this case study, you will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

- What is the dataset that is being used?

    The dataset given, contains historical data about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. 

## Conclusions
- Lending club should reduce the high interest loans for 60 months tenure, they are prone to loan default.
- Grades are good metric for detecting defaulters. Lending club should examine more information from borrowers before issuing loans to Low grade (G to A).
- Lending Club should control their number of loan issues to borrowers who are from CA, FL and NY to make profits.
- Small business loans are defaulted more. Lending club should stop/reduce issuing the loans to them.
- Borrowers with mortgage home ownership are taking higher loans and defaulting the approved loans.
- Lending club should stop giving loans to this category when loan amount requested is more than 12000.
- People with more number of public derogatory records are having more chance of filing a bankruptcy. 
- Lending club should make sure there are no public derogatory records for borrower.
